# Description of key algorithm implementation files
"state_presentation.py": Obtain a high-level state representation of the robot through hierarchical graph networks and communication models. In addition, the graph attention network (GAT) is implemented in the file.

"graph_conv_model.py"ï¼šImplementing Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

"meppo.py":Part of the implementation of the MEPPO algorithm, and the rest of the modifications are included in the "state_presentation.py", "rlagent.py" and "learner.py", which can be found by searching for "meppo".
